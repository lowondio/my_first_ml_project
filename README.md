# First ML Project. First time at GitHub
Predicting House Prices using Advanced Regression Techniques.

This project focuses on predicting residential home prices in Ames, Iowa. Using the Ames Housing dataset, the goal was to build a robust regression model that minimizes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
The project demonstrates a complete Data Science lifecycle: from deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and advanced Feature Engineering to building complex Pipelines with Log-Transformed Targets using Ridge, Lasso, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

After experimenting with various models, the Ridge(log) achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 19663.
